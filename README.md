### Jupyter/IPython Beam Simulation Container (radiasoft/beamsim-jupyter)

For a description of the majority of particle accelerator and FEL beam
simulation codes, please see
[radiasoft/container-beamsim](https://github.com/radiasoft/container-beamsim).

Additional codes and major libraries:

* [FBPIC (Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell)](https://fbpic.github.io)is
  a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code for relativistic plasma physics. It is
  especially well-suited for physical simulations of laser-wakefield
  acceleration and plasma-wakefield acceleration.
* [GPy](https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/) is a Gaussian Process (GP)
  framework written in python, from the Sheffield machine learning
  group.
* [Keras](http://keras.io) is a high-level neural networks API,
  written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK,
  or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast
  experimentation.
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) provides a range of
  supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent
  interface in Python.
* [SciPy stack](https://www.scipy.org) is a Python-based ecosystem of
  open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. In
  particular, these are some of the core packages: NumPy, SciPy
  library, Matplotlib, IPython, Sympy, Pandas.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is a Python data visualization
  library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for
  drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) is an end-to-end open
  source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive,
  flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that
  lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers
  easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
* [YT](https://yt-project.org) supports structured,
  variable-resolution meshes, unstructured meshes, and discrete or
  sampled data such as particles. Focused on driving
  physically-meaningful inquiry, yt has been applied in domains such
  as astrophysics, seismology, nuclear engineering, molecular
  dynamics, and oceanography.
