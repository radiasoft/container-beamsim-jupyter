### Jupyter/IPython Beam Simulation Container (radiasoft/beamsim-jupyter)

For a description of the majority of particle accelerator and FEL beam
simulation codes, please see
[radiasoft/container-beamsim](https://github.com/radiasoft/container-beamsim).

Additional codes and major libraries:

* [FBPIC (Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell)](https://fbpic.github.io) is
  a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code for relativistic plasma physics. It is
  especially well-suited for physical simulations of laser-wakefield
  acceleration and plasma-wakefield acceleration.
* [GPy](https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/) is a Gaussian Process (GP)
  framework written in python, from the Sheffield machine learning
  group.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is a Python data visualization
  library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for
  drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
* [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) includes all the major
  TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts that are free
  software, including support for many languages around the world.
* [YT](https://yt-project.org) supports structured,
  variable-resolution meshes, unstructured meshes, and discrete or
  sampled data such as particles. Focused on driving
  physically-meaningful inquiry, yt has been applied in domains such
  as astrophysics, seismology, nuclear engineering, molecular
  dynamics, and oceanography.
